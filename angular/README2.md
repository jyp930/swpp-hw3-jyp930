# SWPP-HW2

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Comments on files

Files that are created inside the `skeleton` (root) and `src` folder have been already discussed during the practice session (contents in [this link](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart#project-file-review)). You are not expected to create e2e tests just yet, but each `*.ts` files under your `src/app` directory should have corresponding `*.spec.ts` files that performs unit tests on your code. As we have done so in our practice sessions, you are expected to add components under the `src/app` directory freely, according to your needs. Nicely refactored code will result in better readability and is recommended. 

The `in-memory-data.service.ts` file is added to provide mock-backend for you to test out your application, and serves as specified above. Please do not modify this file. Under `src/app/*`, You are expected to create `Services` that communicate using HTTP, and `Components` that produce each pages meeting the requirements. The existing `AppCompoenent` is expected to be the root component of the entire application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
